1) This is a HTML+CSS layout of a one page style website.
2) I need to create five sections in total including a footer.
3) A menu is also required but we are unable to see how the menu is supposed to look so we can safely ignore that at this point.
4) Each section has a different layout thence we must create several elements inside sections.
5) The footer has icons as links which can be styled quite easily and the images can be used or they can be imported using font-awesome.
