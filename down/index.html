      <h1>It's not all Up, Downs also exist</h1>
      <p>This is something that I could have made a blog post about, but I wanted to write it here. This week was a bad one for me, when I look back at the week, I see almost zero progress made during the week. I felt down considering that my previous weeks had been phenomenal.</p>

      <p>The entire week, I was cursing myself for not being able to perform and frankly, I did not know what to do. As the week ended however, I felt my splendour coming back to me, I feel more powerful when I do certain things. I feel the sense of accomplishment.</p>

      <p>This has cleared up something for me once again and possibly forever. Life has ups and life has downs, you will have burnout, you will have energy drains. There will be days when you feel you just cannot push through. But that is time when the winners and losers are separated. Winners stick through or as my friend Owen likes to say <strong>"Hammer it out until the bitter F**kin End"</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>That is life. You must hammer it out, you must not let the flow of the moment confuse you about what you are doing and what you are supposed to do. Excitement and enthusiasm must not be confused for pragmatic matters.</p>
      <p>I feel relieved writing this, it has given a meaning to the week I've had.</p>
