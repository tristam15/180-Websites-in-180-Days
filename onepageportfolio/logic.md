Goal: Create a responsive web design layout as given in the image.
1) There are 9 sections in total including a header and footer.
2) The header will begin with the logo, the navbar, the menu in addition to the transparent bg.
3) The hero section will be a regular section.
4) The portfolio section will be a few images neatly positioned using flex.
5) The about section is a 2 column layout in desktop and a one column layout in a mobile device.
6) The contact us section is a form.
7) The location section will require a setting up of a container for the map.
8) The table section is a regular table which needs some CSS table magic to make it look the way it does.
9) The info section is a informative one.
10)The footer has copyright information.









Questions
1) Should I approach the design using a mobile first approach or a desktop first approach?
