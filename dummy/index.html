        <p>Superb, now that I have your attention, let me elucidate what exactly I am doing. I found out that my daily website is taking too much time to build, taking time that I currently cannot afford to spend.

        <p class="mb-0">I am now allowing myself to use any framework under the sun. By allowing myself such freedom, I will gain two things.
          <ul>
            <li>Firstly, I will learn to ship fast, I mean lightning fast.</li>
            <li>Secondly, as the only thing that matters is the end result, I get to increase the quality of my products.</li>
